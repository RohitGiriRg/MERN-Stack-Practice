**_Mern Practical task :-_**

**User Authentication:**

Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
Create a registration page with input validation, password hashing, and error handling.
Develop a login page with proper authentication checks and session management.
CRUD Operations:

Build a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for a specific entity (e.g., a to-do list, blog posts, or contacts).
Ensure proper validation, error handling, and user feedback during CRUD operations.
Implement authorization to allow only authenticated users to perform certain operations.
File Upload and Handling:

Allow users to upload files (images, documents) to the server.
Implement file storage using a service like Amazon S3 or local storage.
Display uploaded files and provide functionality to delete them.
Real-time Chat Application:

Create a real-time chat application using WebSockets (you can use libraries like Socket.io).
Allow users to join chat rooms, send messages, and receive messages in real-time.
Implement user presence indicators (online/offline status).
Pagination and Sorting:

Implement pagination for displaying a large set of data with a limited number of items per page.
Add sorting functionality for different attributes (e.g., date, name) in ascending and descending order.
Ensure a smooth user experience when navigating through paginated data.
RESTful API Development:

Design and implement a RESTful API for a specific domain (e.g., a bookstore, inventory management).
Include endpoints for CRUD operations and adhere to RESTful principles.
Document the API using tools like Swagger or API Blueprint.
User Profile and Authorization:

Create user profiles with editable information and profile pictures.
Implement role-based access control to restrict certain functionalities to specific user roles.
Use middleware to check user permissions before allowing access to certain routes.
Error Handling and Logging:

Implement a robust error handling mechanism throughout your application.
Set up logging to capture errors, warnings, and other relevant information.
Utilize error boundary components in React for graceful error handling in the UI.
Integration Testing:

Write integration tests for critical parts of your application using tools like Jest or Mocha.
Test API endpoints, authentication flows, and CRUD operations.
Ensure that the tests cover edge cases and handle asynchronous operations properly.
Deployment and Continuous Integration:

Deploy your MERN application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Azure).
Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.
Ensure that environment variables are securely handled, and the application runs smoothly in a production environment.
These tasks cover various aspects of MERN development and provide a holistic approach to building robust and scalable applications.
