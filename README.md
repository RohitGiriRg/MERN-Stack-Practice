**_Mern Practical task :-_**

1. **User Authentication:**

   - Implement user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication.
   - Create a registration page with input validation, password hashing, and error handling.
   - Develop a login page with proper authentication checks and session management.

2. **CRUD Operations:**

   - Build a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for a specific entity (e.g., a to-do list, blog posts, or contacts).
   - Ensure proper validation, error handling, and user feedback during CRUD operations.
   - Implement authorization to allow only authenticated users to perform certain operations.

3. **File Upload and Handling:**

   - Allow users to upload files (images, documents) to the server.
   - Implement file storage using a service like Amazon S3 or local storage.
   - Display uploaded files and provide functionality to delete them.

4. **Real-time Chat Application:**

   - Create a real-time chat application using WebSockets (you can use libraries like Socket.io).
   - Allow users to join chat rooms, send messages, and receive messages in real-time.
   - Implement user presence indicators (online/offline status).

5. **Pagination and Sorting:**

   - Implement pagination for displaying a large set of data with a limited number of items per page.
   - Add sorting functionality for different attributes (e.g., date, name) in ascending and descending order.
   - Ensure a smooth user experience when navigating through paginated data.

6. **RESTful API Development:**

   - Design and implement a RESTful API for a specific domain (e.g., a bookstore, inventory management).
   - Include endpoints for CRUD operations and adhere to RESTful principles.
   - Document the API using tools like Swagger or API Blueprint.

7. **User Profile and Authorization:**

   - Create user profiles with editable information and profile pictures.
   - Implement role-based access control to restrict certain functionalities to specific user roles.
   - Use middleware to check user permissions before allowing access to certain routes.

8. **Error Handling and Logging:**

   - Implement a robust error handling mechanism throughout your application.
   - Set up logging to capture errors, warnings, and other relevant information.
   - Utilize error boundary components in React for graceful error handling in the UI.

9. **Integration Testing:**

   - Write integration tests for critical parts of your application using tools like Jest or Mocha.
   - Test API endpoints, authentication flows, and CRUD operations.
   - Ensure that the tests cover edge cases and handle asynchronous operations properly.

10. **Deployment and Continuous Integration:**

    - Deploy your MERN application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Azure).
    - Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment process.
    - Ensure that environment variables are securely handled, and the application runs smoothly in a production environment.
